# Blooket RNG Tool

A simple tool to change the outcome of Blooket's random number generator. Allows you to get the same rewards every time you answer a question. Currently incompatible with [answer.js](https://github.com/mmccall0813/answer.js) but I am working on making them compatible.

How to use:
- Use the rng codes generator for the mode you want to play.
    - [Gold Quest](https://mmccall0813.github.io/blooket-rng-tool/gold-quest.html)
- Run the tool on Blooket, then input the rng codes you got from the generator.
- You will get the rewards you chose in the generator.
